# Clicky Game using React: Game of Thrones Edition

## About
This is a memory challenge built with React. 

## Objective
The user objective is to click on as many images as possible without clicking on any image twice. Each time an image is clicked, the images reshuffle into different positions. The Score builds until an image is clicked a second time and then resets. The High Score resets each time there is a longer streak reached of not clicking on an image for a second time.
